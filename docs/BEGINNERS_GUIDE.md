# üî∞ Beginner's Guide to 404 ENTERPRISE

Welcome to the Stock & HR Management System! This guide is designed to help absolute beginners understand, install, and use the system. We'll go through each step in detail, with clear explanations.

## üìñ What is 404 ENTERPRISE?

404 ENTERPRISE is a comprehensive application that helps businesses in Algeria:
- Track inventory and stock levels
- Manage employee information and HR processes
- Create and track contracts
- Generate invoices and manage accounting
- View business metrics through a comprehensive dashboard
- Handle financial statements and reporting
- Manage suppliers and purchase orders

Think of it as your business's digital command center where you can manage everything in one place.

## üíª Before You Begin

### What You Need

1. **A Computer** with:
   - Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, or a Linux distribution
   - At least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
   - At least 10GB free disk space

2. **Internet Connection**
   - For downloading the software and dependencies
   - For accessing the application if deployed to a server

3. **Basic Computer Skills**
   - Typing and using a keyboard/mouse
   - Opening terminal/command prompt
   - Navigating file systems
   - Copy and paste operations

## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Step 1: Understanding the Components

The system consists of two main parts:

1. **Frontend**: What you see in your browser (the user interface)
2. **Backend**: The server that handles data storage and business logic

Think of the frontend as the dashboard of a car, and the backend as the engine. You interact with the dashboard, but the engine does all the heavy lifting.

## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Step 2: Installing Prerequisites

### Installing Node.js

Node.js is the engine that powers our application.

   # On macOS/Linux
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Step 4.3: Setting Up the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   # If you're in the frontend directory
   cd ../backend

   # If you're in the root directory
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Create environment configuration:
   ```
   # On Windows

   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Step 4.4: Configure Environment Files

1. Open the `.env` file in the frontend directory with a text editor
   - Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` to `http://localhost:5000/api`

2. Open the `.env` file in the backend directory with a text editor
   - Set `PORT` to `5000`
   - Set `MONGODB_URI` to `mongodb://localhost:27017/404enterprise`
   - Set `JWT_SECRET` to any random string (e.g., `my_super_secret_key`)
   - Set `NODE_ENV` to `development`

## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Step 5: Starting the Application

### Step 5.1: Ensure MongoDB is Running

#### On Windows:
1. MongoDB should be running as a service if you installed it that way
2. To verify: Open Command Prompt and run:
   ```
   sc query MongoDB
   ```
3. If it shows "RUNNING", it's good to go!

#### On macOS:
```
brew services list
```
Look for mongodb-community and check if it's started

### Step 5.3: Start the Frontend Server

1. Open a new Terminal/Command Prompt window (keep the backend one running!)
2. Navigate to the frontend directory
3. Run:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. A browser window should automatically open showing the application
